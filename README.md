# Description 
This is a project that collects data from the user through prompted questions via the command line. The motivation to create this was for the user to easily be able to create a profile for their team with specific parameters. This was created with Node JS, using inquirer, which prompts the user, and jest, which helps run tests on the project. This solves the amount of time it would take for the user to manually create a website with their team profile, as this quickly creates a styled website with the users specified data that was collected through the console prompts. I learned how to create an html file with the user's data and collect and display specific kinds of data that was collected from the user.
